Nextflow Tower is an open source monitoring and managing platform
for [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflows. Learn more at [tower.nf](https://tower.nf/).

## Build the environment

```bash
make build
```

## Run locally

```bash
make run
```

See `docker-compose.yml` file for details.


## Backend settings

Tower backend settings can be provided in either:

- `application.yml` in the backend class-path
- `tower.yml` in the launching directory

A minimal config requires the settings for the SMTP
server, using the following variables:

- `TOWER_SMTP_HOST`: The SMTP server host name e.g. `email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`.
- `TOWER_SMTP_PORT`: The SMTP server port number e.g. `587`.
- `TOWER_SMTP_USER`: The SMTP user name.
- `TOWER_SMTP_PASSWORD`: The SMTP user password.

## Basic use case

Navigate to GUI in `http://localhost:8000` and follow the instructions.

# Development

### Backend execution

Define the following env variables:

- `TOWER_SMTP_USER=<smtp user name>`
- `TOWER_SMTP_PASSWORD=<smpt password>`

See `tower-backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` for further config details.

Launch the backend with the command:

```bash
./gradlew tower-backend:run --continuous
```

### Frontend execution

```bash
cd tower-web
npm install
npm run livedev
```

## Database

Tower is designed to be database agnostic and can use most popular SQL
database servers, such as MySql, Postgres, Oracle and many other.

By default it uses [H2](https://www.h2database.com), an embedded database meant to be used for evaluation purpose only.
